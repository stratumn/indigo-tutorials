TODO tutorial series.

## Requirements

- [Docker >= 1.10](https://www.docker.com/products/docker)
- [Docker Compose >= 1.6](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install)

Docker Compose is already included in some distributions of Docker.

You can check versions by running:

```
$ docker version
$ docker-compose version
```

Your installation of Docker must bind containers to `127.0.0.1` in order for the
agent user interface to work properly (which should already be the case if you
are using a recent release of Docker).

To make sure that it is the case, check that the value of `$DOCKER_HOST`
(or `%DOCKER_HOST%` on Windows) is not set:

```
$ echo $DOCKER_HOST # or echo %DOCKER_HOST% on Windows
```

Also make sure Docker is running properly:

```
$ docker run hello-world
```

If your installation of Docker requires `root` permissions, you can add your
username to the `docker` group (you might need to restart your terminal after
doing so).

## Launch development server

To launch all the services locally, run:

```
$ strat up
```

The agent is bound to `http://localhost:3000`. It will automatically restart
when a file is changed.

A web user interface for the agent is available on `http://localhost:4000`.
You can use it to test and visualize your workflows.
A web user interface for the Indigo node is also available on
`http://localhost:8000`. You can use it to explore blocks and view transactions.

Press `Ctrl^C` to stop the services.

**Note:** While the agent will automatically restart if a file changes, you will
have to run `strat up` again if you add NodeJS packages to `package.json`.
During development, the segments will be saved to the `./segments` directory.
Make sure Docker is configured to allow mounting that directory.
Note that the file storage adapter is very slow and only suited for development and
testing.

## Run tests

```
$ strat test
```

## Project structure

The agent's files are in the `./agent` directory.

### Workflow actions

The actions are defined in `./agent/lib/actions-todo.js`.
You can arrange your actions in different files then `require()` them if you
want.

### Tests

The tests are defined in `./agent/test/actions-todo.js`. You can also arrange them in
different files if you prefer.

During tests, the same store and fossilizer types used in development are
launched. They are started in a different namespace so that they don't conflict
with the development Docker containers.

### Configuration

There are some configuration files in `./config` that make it possible to define
environment variables for the services, including your agent.

The variables defined in `common.env` are accessible by all services during
development and testing.

The variables defined in `common.secret.env` work similarly, but will not be
included in a Git repository so it is a good place to define more sensitive
variables.

The variables defined in `dev.env` and `dev.secret.env` are only accessible
during development.

The variables defined in `test.env` and `test.secret.env` are only accessible
during testing.

### Validation

There is a json file in `./validation` named `rules.json`. 
It contains json schema validation rules that are executed for each action your processes handle.
